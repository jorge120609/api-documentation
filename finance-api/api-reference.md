### OAuth Scope
`READ:FINANCE`

For more information on how to get authorisation for the scope, see [OAuth2 API](https://github.com/iZettle/api-documentation/blob/master/authorization.adoc).

## Fetch account balance
Returns the balance in a merchant's preliminary or liquid account at a specific time.

After a deposit has been made from a merchant's liquid account to their bank account or PayPal Wallet for PayPal users (daily, weekly or monthly), the balance is usually zero or the minimum account balance in the merchant's Zettle account. In other cases, you can see how much money is in the merchant's Zettle account.

```
GET /organizations/{organizationUuid}/accounts/{accountTypeGroup}/balance
```

See example [Fetch current balance for a liquid account](#fetch-current-balance-for-a-liquid-account).

## Fetch payout information
Returns payout related information from a merchant's liquid account.

A payout is to deposit the account balance to the merchant's bank account or their PayPal Wallet for PayPal users at the [scheduled time](https://www.zettle.com/help/articles/1084784-deposits). The scheduled time varies depending on the country.

If the merchant's configuration has a minimum account balance, then the payout will deposit the account balance minus the minimum account balance.

```
GET /organizations/{organizationUuid}/payout-info
```

See example [Fetch payout information on a specific period](#fetch-payout-information-on-a-specific-day).

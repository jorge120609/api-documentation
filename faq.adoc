====
.*How do I take payments through the Zettle APIs?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
It is not possible to take payments through the APIs. However, you can take payments using https://github.com/iZettle/sdk-ios[Zettle Payments SDK for iOS] and https://github.com/iZettle/sdk-android[Zettle Payments SDK for Android].

====
.*Do you provide any test or sandbox environment?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
Unfortunately we do not at this time.
****
====
.*Does it cost anything to use your APIs and is there some restriction on the APIs?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
No, it is completely free to use our APIs. The only limitation is that some resources might have rate limiting enabled to ensure service stability.
****
====
.*Why do I receive `HTTP 100 Continue` responses sometimes?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
This is something our framework sends when it has received the request headers and
indicates that the client should proceed to send the request body. What you can do is investigate
the reason why your code does this, or you could traverse the headers until
you find a header with the intended response code. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2964687/how-to-handle-100-continue-http-message[example of handling HTTP 100 Continue] and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14526627/double-http-status-header-on-http-post-to-jersey[ example of handling double HTTP-Status header on HTTP-POST].

== OAuth
.*Once I have an Access token, how do I use it to authenticate myself?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
The Access token is passed through the `Authorization` header with the format:
`Authorization: Bearer <Token>`. Also, note that on most services you can use the `self`
filter instead of `{organizationUuid}`
****
====
.*Do I need my organization UUID when accessing some of the APIs?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
You can use the `self` path parameter instead of specifying organization UUID in an endpoint.

Example request
[source]
--
GET /organizations/self/accounts/{accountTypeGroup}/balance
--

Or, you can fetch the organization UUID by calling the following endpoint.
[source]
--
GET https://oauth.zettle.com/users/self
--
Example response
[source,json]
--

{
    "uuid": "de305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546014",
    "organizationUuid": "ab305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546013"
}

--
After fetching the organization UUID, you can specify it in an endpoint.

Example request
[source]
--
GET /organizations/ab305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546013/accounts/{accountTypeGroup}/balance
--

For more information on the filter and the endpoint, see xref:/authorization.md[OAuth].

== Product Library
.*I'm using your API to create Products on Zettle. I have a problem when assigning images to products. I used the image API to create an image and it's working, but how do I assign this image to the product I'm creating?*
[%collapsible]
====
****

[source,json]
--
 "imageLookupKeys": [
    "string" // What should I put here?
  ],
  "presentation": {
    "imageUrl": "string", // Should I put the created image URL?
    "backgroundColor": "string",
    "textColor": "string"
  },
--

The image API will return a imageUrl back which can be directly put into the `presentation.imageUrl` field, however we just introduced this and is not fully supported by the portal and the apps yet.

So if you only want to use the information outside of the Zettle apps you might want to use  `presentation.imageUrl`, otherwise use  `imageLookupKeys` and strip away everything except the last part of the imageUrl and place for example `Ta0Tx5E6RpujkDRXheIb5w-sS5EEMfKEee84eojOmcEmQ.jpeg` in `imageLookupKeys` to be able to see the image in the Zettle apps.

Clarification examples:
[source,json]
--
"imageLookupKeys": [
      "Ta0Tx5E6RpujkDRXheIb5w-sS5EEMfKEee84eojOmcEnQ.jpeg"
]
"presentation" : {
      "imageUrl": "https://image.izettle.com/v2/images/o/Ta0Tx5E6RpujkDRXheIb5w-sS5EEMfKEee84eojOmcEnQ.jpeg"
}

== Finance
.*How do I get sum of all payments, fees, refunds, invoices?*
[%collapsible]
====
Use `includeTransactionType` parameter in query for the relevant transaction type or types. Then traverse the list of transactions returned and sum up the amounts.
